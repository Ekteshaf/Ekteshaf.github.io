Seeing as second term is coming up I felt like I might as well reflect on the fury/fun/craziness/excitement of first term. To keep things short I'll only concentrate on the engineering parts seeing as I don't want to write a novel here...

Back in highschool I remember stressing out over uni admissions, having a mindset that getting in was the hard part. Also there were many rumors floating around about how university was compared to high school:

`First term of university is all review ~ all teachers`
`Oh you're from Vincent Massey Secondary School, you're golden ~ Recruiter from my local university`
`These courses in first year are easy, that one is hard ~ orientation leader`

These quotes were neither correct nor incorrect. 

*Is first term all review??*

Eh...kind of? Depends on the course:

**Chem**: Style of problems were much more difficult than high school but still doable and generally most people did alright. 

**Calc 1**: The high school I came from was really big on math so Calc 1 didn't feel challenging to me. It definately wasn't straight forward considering there was a lot of brute force required for some integration assignments.

**Physics:** 9000/10 this course was special. Our class had a failing average on the midterm which was all F=MA. In retrospect its nice to see the origins of physics contest material and it was a fun course.

**Programming:** Meant to be hard for newbies but not super easy. I found it easy and spent just as much time ranting about how we couldn't have the same programming class as the software engineers.

**Circuits**: Only course that didn't fall under review for me so the concepts were hard to grasp at first. I really enjoyed the theory behind circuit analysis (especially the elegant mathematics behind phasors) but the actual problems consisted of the most brute force I've ever seen. 

...oh yea and then theres a random seminar course which tried to fit 10 slides into 2 hours of lecture time

*Does coming from a good high school help a lot*

Not really. Although I felt better at some courses than others but everyone here is smart (waterloo engineering). Don't rely on your highschool knowledge or habits.

*Wait so which courses are easy*

Depends on the individual. I found chem harder than calc which was uncommon... I find the courses you will struggle at are likely the ones you aren't interested in. Physics however is undoubtedly the most difficult.

Despite the struggle of first year every moment was worthwhile. The biggest issue though would have to be time. I personally had to sacrifice video games for the most part in first semester to try and lead a balanced lifestyle ;_; 

It's only going to get harder from here, but I enjoy challenges and the courses are getting even more interesting. I signed up for this after all.

TL;DR: It's fast. It's fun. It's first year waterloo engineering.
